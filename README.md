### Skelton and the Skeletons
As of today, the sprite sheet for the main character, Skelton, has been created and is ready for use. Additionally the story outline is nearly done and will be uploaded here when ready. It can be seen below.

Obviously Skelton and the regular skeletons are differentiated only by the color of their eyes, which is intentional, as Skelton is a skeleton of the people and doesn't stand out in a crowd of the rank and file.

I'm not an experienced artist of any kind, so this sprite sheet will likely be a place holder for a more refined version in the future. I was just trying to think of bald wizard essentially.  This sprite may become a sprite for the necro mid-managers that Skelton faces.

### More Sprites Coming
Currently I'm working on a sprite sheet for the environment as well as "special" skeletons and a few human sprites that will be critical in the opening of the game.
